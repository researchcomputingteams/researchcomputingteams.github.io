                <p>Research Computing is a tough field that combines the challenges of many disciplines.</p>
<p>Like IT or commercial software development, we need to deliver real usable tools
to support our users; but like research, our projects are often extremely open-ended,
with complexity coming not from unvalidated requirements but the uncertaintainty
of the new, requiring experimentation and discovery.  Like academia,
we often work with team members who are trainees, not employees; like nonprofits
we are called on to enact real changes with ongoing programmes or products while
funded only by budgets dependent on multiple short-term grants.</p>
<p>But while there are many websites and podcasts, newsletters and tutorials, on the
bytes and flops and Mbit/s of research computing, there is very little out there on the
genuinely hard day-to-day work of designing, building and managing R&amp;D computing
teams, projects, and software.  Commercial or open-source software development,
research, nonprofit, IT, business - our field is too different for advice from
those fields to routinely directly carry over, even if there are lessons we can
learn from them.</p>
